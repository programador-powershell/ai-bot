   * IT REFUSES WHILE THE CONVERSATION IS DISABLED, which is the one thing "however it ended" must
   * not be read to cover. A coworker deleted mid-turn takes the channel with it: the composer stops
   * accepting messages and the notice under it says the conversation can no longer reply, and a
   * queue that drained anyway would post one more user turn into a channel the screen has already
   * said is finished. The cost is that anything parked when that happens stays on screen unrun,
