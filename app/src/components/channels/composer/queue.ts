/**
 * What happens to a message typed while the Bot already has the turn.
 *
 * The composer used to refuse it. Enter did nothing, the words stayed in the box, and a person
 * watching their coworker head off in the wrong direction had two options: stop the turn and start
 * again, losing whatever it had already done, or wait for it to finish being wrong. Neither is the
 * thing they wanted, which was to say "no, the other one" while it was working and have that land.
 *
 * So a message typed mid-turn is parked rather than dropped, and everything parked runs as ONE
 * follow-up turn when the current one settles. One turn and not one per message, because three
 * quick corrections are usually one correction typed in three breaths: replaying them separately
 * makes the Bot answer the first, act on it, and only then read the sentence saying not to.
 *
 * Settling is not the same as succeeding. The drain is keyed on the turn ENDING and never asks how
 * it ended, which is what makes Stop a way of steering rather than a way of giving up: park a
 * correction, press Stop, and the correction is what runs next. Nothing here special-cases the stop
 * button, and that is the point — a path with its own branch is a path that can be forgotten.
 *
 * THE QUEUE IS MEMORY IN ONE MOUNT AND NOTHING HERE PRETENDS OTHERWISE. The turn is driven from the
 * browser, so the browser is the only place that knows one is in flight, and this state lives and
 * dies with the component holding it. A reload loses the intent to run these words later, and so
 * does walking to another channel: the channel view is keyed on the channel, so switching unmounts
 * the conversation and takes anything parked in it with it, after the person has watched their
 * words land on screen. Neither is worth a persistence layer for words that only mean anything
 * inside a turn that is already over by the time you come back, but both are worth saying out loud.
 * The words are the person's own and sit on screen for as long as they wait, so nothing is being
 * kept from anybody; but a queue is not an outbox and must not be read as one. It is drawn only
 * while a turn is in flight, so a reload finds no queue and shows none, which is better than a list
 * of messages quietly promising to run and never running.
