/**
 * The CopilotKit client, wrapped once for the whole authenticated app.
 *
 * `credentials: "include"` is the load-bearing part. OpenBot authenticates with a Better Auth
 * session cookie, and the runtime endpoint sits behind the same guard as every other API route, so
 * without it every run is rejected as anonymous while the rest of the app looks signed in.
 *
 * The URL is relative, like every other call in the app, so the Vite dev proxy and a single-origin
 * deployment both work without a build-time base URL to get wrong.
 *
 * There is no `publicApiKey`. The Intelligence key and licence token are deployment secrets held by
 * the server; a browser never sees them (see server/src/app.ts, where /api/capabilities projects the
 * runtime rather than returning it).
