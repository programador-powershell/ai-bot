/**
 * Why the last turn ended without an answer, for a surface that has to say so itself.
 *
 * A run can end three ways. It finishes, which needs no explanation. It fails in the browser, which
 * arrives as an error. Or the Bot's own stream stops producing anything and this deployment ends the
 * turn for it, which arrives as a RUN_ERROR carrying the sentence the server wrote (see
 * server/src/channels/stall-guard.ts). The last two both leave the same hole on screen: the composer
 * unlocks, the spinner disappears, and nothing says what happened.
 *
 * The reason is kept as a sentence rather than a flag because the reasons are not interchangeable. A
 * Bot that refused, a Bot whose endpoint is down and a Bot that simply stopped talking are three
 * different things to be told, and only the thing that ended the turn knows which one it was.
 */

/**
 * The sentence to show, in the words of whatever ended the turn.
 *
 * Falls back only when there is genuinely nothing to pass on. Saying "the Bot stopped without saying
 * why" is honest about that; inventing a cause would not be, and this is the one moment a person has
 * no other way to find out what went wrong.

 * does not have to reach for one: `useAgent` returns the same shared instance the chat itself binds
 * to, so this watches exactly the runs that chat starts.
 *
 * Cleared when the next run begins rather than on a timer. A sentence about a turn that is over
 * should stay until there is something newer to look at, and the person deciding when that is is the
 * one who sends the next message.
