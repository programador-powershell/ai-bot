 * A component authored in a browser can be edited freely and still reach nobody until it is

 *
 * These tests pin the draft gate. Publishing without a rebuild is what this table is
 * for, and it is also what puts an editor one keystroke away from changing what every Bot draws in
 * production. If a draft could ever be drawn, the feature would be a liability rather than a
 * capability, so that is asserted directly rather than inferred from the shape of the code.
