/**
 * The connection test, against something that really speaks AG-UI.
 *
 * Uses a real AG-UI mock rather than a stubbed fetch. The other tests for this hand it a function that returns a hand-written
 * SSE body, which proves the parsing and nothing about the protocol: every one of them would still
 * pass if AG-UI changed its wire format underneath us, or if we had misread it in the first place.
 * The whole promise is that somebody else's agent works if it speaks this protocol, so the
 * test that matters is one where an implementation we did not write answers.
 *
 * `@copilotkit/aimock` is ours, which is the point: it is the org's deterministic backend for
 * exactly this, it tracks the protocol as the protocol moves, and using it here means OpenBot finds
 * out about a drift in the same week as everything else that depends on it rather than in a
 * customer's integration.
 *
 * Deterministic and offline. No key, no network, no spend, and the same answer on every run, so
 * this belongs in CI, which is where an agent-facing contract most needs watching.
