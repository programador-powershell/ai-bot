/**
 * These test the distinction the watchdog exists to draw, not the plumbing around it.
 *
 * Every case is one a deployment can actually be in: a Bot that answers slowly and is fine, a Bot
 * that answered once and then stopped, a Bot that accepted the connection and never wrote a byte.
 * Time is injected rather than waited for, so a two-minute timeout is tested in no time at all and
 * the assertions are about the rule rather than about how fast the machine running them is.
 *
 * There is no exemption for a frontend tool call and therefore no test of one. The run ends before
 * the browser executes a tool and a second run carries the result back, so no stream is ever held
 * open across one; see the module comment on turn-watchdog.ts for what was measured.
