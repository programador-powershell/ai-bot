 * A component is allowed by two grants: the Bot may use it, and it may read the data it draws. Both
 * are enforced when the data is fetched, which happens while the component renders. The decision is
 * asked before that, and answers whoever asked for the component, so it has to speak for the data
 * as well when the caller says which data that is.
