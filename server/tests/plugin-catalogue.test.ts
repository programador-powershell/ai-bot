 * The catalogue decides two things that are worth being sure about: which addresses this deployment

 *
 * Both fail closed, and both are tested for that rather than for the happy path. An admissibility
 * check that accepts one address too many is a request-forgery primitive; an effect classifier that
 * calls a write a read is a governance surface that quietly stops covering the thing it exists for.
