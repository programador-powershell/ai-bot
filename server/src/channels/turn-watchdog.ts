/**
 * Whether a turn has gone quiet, which is not the same question as whether it has taken a long time.
 *
 * A turn may legitimately run for an hour. A Bot reading a long document, or a model writing slowly,
 * produces events the whole way and there is nothing wrong with it. A turn whose stream has produced
 * nothing at all for `stallMs` is wedged. Telling those apart by activity rather than by duration is
 * the whole design, and the difference matters: a duration limit puts a ceiling on how much work a
 * Bot is allowed to do, which nobody asked for, whereas a silence limit puts a ceiling on how long a
 * person is asked to watch a spinner, which is the actual complaint.
 *
 * SILENCE ONLY MEANS ANYTHING WHILE THIS PROCESS IS WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE BOT. The Bot's stream
 * is relayed onward as it arrives, and whoever reads the relayed copy is entitled to take its time:
 * in Intelligence mode that reader is publishing every event on to the gateway over the network. A
 * chunk sitting in that handover is quiet that says nothing about the endpoint, and counting it
 * would end a run that was streaming perfectly and put the blame on a Bot for a pause on this side
 * of the wire. That is the one outcome a watchdog must never produce, so the clock is stopped for
 * the handover and started again when it completes, which is what `pause` and `resume` are for.
 *
 * WHAT THE STREAM ACTUALLY DOES IN THIS PRODUCT, measured before any of this was designed, because
 * the answer decides whether a long tool call would be reported as a stall.
 *
 * OpenBot runs in Intelligence mode and has no other mode, so `POST /api/copilotkit/agent/:id/run`
 * does not stream at all. It answers `Content-Type: application/json` with a fixed Content-Length in
 * about a second, carrying a join token, and the AG-UI events reach the browser over a WebSocket to
 * the Intelligence gateway. Wrapping that response body would watch a JSON envelope go past. The
 * stream that can actually stall is the one on the other side of this server: the Bot's own AG-UI
 * response, read here, event by event, and republished to the gateway. That is the stream this
 * watchdog is pointed at, and stall-guard.ts is where it is wrapped.
 *
 * The computer tools are frontend tools, executed in the browser, and the run ENDS before the
 * browser runs one. The Bot emits TOOL_CALL_START, ARGS and END and then RUN_FINISHED, its stream
 * closes, the browser executes the tool, and the CopilotKit client opens a SECOND run carrying the
 * result. Verified in @copilotkit/core 1.67.1, whose `processAgentResult` executes frontend tools
 * only after `agent.runAgent` has resolved and then re-enters `runAgent`, and against `agent-bot` in
 * this repository, which writes its tool calls followed by RUN_FINISHED and closes the stream.
 *
 * So no exemption for tool calls exists here, and none is needed. A browser tool that takes ten
 * minutes holds no stream open, because there is no stream open while it runs. An exemption would be
 * a hole in the only thing this watchdog does, opened for a case that does not occur.
 *
 * It holds no timer of its own. The clock is injected and `sweep` is called by whoever owns the
 * schedule, so a test can move time by a minute without waiting one, and so the decision about when
 * to look is made in one place rather than hidden in here.
