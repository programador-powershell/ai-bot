/**
 * What a Bot's browser is allowed to navigate to.
 *
 * A computer-use browser is an SSRF engine pointed at your own network unless something stops it.
 * The Bot runs inside the deployment, so `http://localhost:5432`, the cloud metadata endpoint at
 * 169.254.169.254, and every RFC1918 address are all reachable from it and none of them are reachable
 * from the person's laptop. A model that has been talked into "check what is on 10.0.0.5" would
 * otherwise do exactly that and screenshot the result back into the transcript.
 *
 * This is an allow-list of schemes plus a deny-list of destinations, applied before the request is
 * made rather than after. It is deliberately dumb: no DNS resolution, no redirect following, no
 * cleverness that could disagree with what the browser eventually does. The gateway sits in front
 * of every action, which is where policy per Bot belongs; this is the floor that holds even without it.
