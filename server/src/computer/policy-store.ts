/**
 * The policy the gateway is currently enforcing, and the ability to change it while running.
 *
 * It survives a restart. A rule held only in memory vanishes the next time the process comes up, and
 * the trail shows it being added without showing that it stopped applying. A reader would believe a
 * boundary held at a moment when it did not, and a form going through after a restart is
 * indistinguishable from a rule that never applied.
 *
 * Memory is the cache, and the table is the record. The gateway asks for the policy on every single
 * action, so `get` stays synchronous and reads from memory; the write goes through to the database
 * and the memory copy is only updated once it has. A store that answered from the database on every
 * click would put a query on the path of every keystroke a Bot makes.
 *
 * Without a database it still works in memory. Tests that only care about decision logic do not need
 * Postgres.
