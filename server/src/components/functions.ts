/**
 * The data a component may fetch for itself, instead of being handed figures by a model.
 *
 * A component fetches its own data because a component drawn from the model's arguments alone means
 * every number on screen is a number a model produced. For a chart of revenue that is a
 * hallucination with axes. Here the model passes a query, which report, over how many days, and the
 * figures come from this deployment. The model never sees them and cannot invent them.
 *
 * The allow-list is enforced on the server, not in the browser. A compiled React component has
 * the whole application: it can call `fetch` itself, so a list of permitted functions held beside it
 * is documentation, not a control. The only place a permission can be enforced is the place that
 * holds the data. `useSandboxFunctions` is the browser-side equivalent for code running in an
 * isolated frame, which is a different path.
 *
 * Arguments are checked here too, for the same reason: whatever the browser sends is a claim.
 * Bounded rather than merely parsed, a report is a thing somebody watches load, so "how many days"
 * has a ceiling instead of trusting a number that arrived over the wire.
 *
 * These read the trail directly.
 *
 * What these read. A fresh deployment has no connector and no documents, so the worked example reads
 * the one dataset that is always real and always present: this deployment's own audit trail. The seam
 * is the point, a function that reads a customer's connector is another entry in this list, and
 * nothing above it changes.
