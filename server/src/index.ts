 *  - §4.6/R3: o mount do CopilotKit Intelligence NÃO sobe — o server nasce sem
 *    SaaS e sem degraded-mode fingido; copilot.ts fica fora do boot com prazo
 *    de morte (onda 2/3).
 *  - §4.4/R2: o banco do chassis é bun:sqlite (chassis.db) com migrações
 *    geradas aplicadas AQUI no boot; nenhuma rota Postgres viva.
 *  - O listener LISTEN/NOTIFY do Postgres virou anúncio in-process (um
 *    processo, um banco embutido) — ver channels/events.ts.
 * O restante preserva o desenho original: Bun.serve multiplexa fetch+upgrade,
 * o proxy do live screen termina a sessão aqui e disca para dentro com token.
