/**
 * A component a Bot may answer with, and the state that governs it.

 * The code owns the component; this table owns its governance. The React file and its schema are
 * compiled into the app and cannot be edited from here. What lives in a row is everything a
 * deployment decides at runtime: whether it is published at all, what the model is told about it, and
 * who last changed that. A fork that deletes `RecordCard` leaves a row with nothing to draw it, which
 * the Admin page reports rather than hiding, a catalogue that silently disagrees with the build is
 * worse than one that says so.
 *
 * `name` is the primary key and a contract. It is the tool name the model calls, the key the
 * app maps to a renderer, and the thing a customer's fork keeps when it replaces the component. A
 * surrogate id would let two rows claim one name and would break that mapping silently.
